## Description

Employees are the bedrock of any business - your most precious resource, and your partners for success. No matter what size your operation, having a way to centrally store and access non-sensitive data about those working for you is essential. Enter OrgChart. Powered by React, this easily deployable, modular application allows you to pull from a database, sort, and search through your employee records quickly and easily.
